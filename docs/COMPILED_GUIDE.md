## Step 1: Download the app

- Download the compiled version for your system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SmartsvXD/InstaUnfollowerFinder/releases):
  - **"InstaUNfollowerFinder.dmg"** for macOS.
  - **"InstaUnfollowerFinder.exe"** for Windows.
- Install and run the app (read the security note if necessary).

## Step 2: Find Unfollowers

- Download Instagram information (explained below).
- Click on **"Find Unfollowers"**, and select `followers.json` and `following_1.json` from the folder `connections/followers_and_following` inside the folder you downloaded from Instagram (once you have extracted the ZIP file). If everything is done correctly it should show the list of accounts.

## Step 3: Extra Features

- By clicking on the username of the unfollower you can open their Instagram page on your default browser.
- By clicking on the blue plus on the left of each username you can add it to the whitelist.

## üîí Security Notice

The compiled versions of this app are not digitally signed (the certificate is expensive and I'm poor üëç). This means both macOS and Windows may block the application when you try to open it, as the system doesn't recognize the developer. Here's how to bypass this and run the app safely.

### Running the App on Windows

- Double-click to open the app. A blue warning window may appear.
- Click on **"More info"**.
- Click on **"Run anyway"**.
- You may be prompted to enter your computer's administrator password.

### Running the App on macOS

- Try to open the app. A window will appear stating that macOS cannot verify the developer.
- Close that window.
- Open **System Settings** and go to **Privacy & Security**.
- Scroll down until you see a message saying that the app was blocked.
- Click **"Open Anyway"**.
- The app should now launch properly.
